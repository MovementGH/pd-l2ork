CHANGELOG (Date Format: DD-MM-YYYY)
-----------------------------------
27-10-2021 0.55
*Implemented synced session saving where master client sends its literal session to others, to offset for any potential latency-induced inconsistencies.
*Added ability for the Teacher widget to (re)sync based on the last loaded session.
*Bunch of small Teacher widget bug-fixes.
*Fixed obscure bug in the tracker-time logic that prevented perfect sync from happening while online.
*Refactored the session sync all highlighting logic, so that it appropriately shows up on all clients.
*Added L2OrkTweet abstraction designed for use in DISIS (L2OrkTweetDISIS.pd found in the core folder).
*Included DISIS Dante mixer widget (DISIS-Dante-Out-Controls.pd found in the admin folder) since the DISIS Dante system does not have an easy way of adjusting levels.

23-10-2021 0.54
*Added ability to request your client number to enable greater flexibility in supporting widgets, such as the Teacher widget.
*Further improvements to the Teacher widget, including fixing the double output by the user monitored through the teacher widget and other out-of-sync issues, refining the session load and adding the save option, preloading delay and other values, toggling the metro off after it has been on when transitioning to a user that does not have tracker on, and visually acknowledging that you cannot control your own part through the teacher widget.
*Further improvements to the audio level toggles, so that they are not affected by the remote session loading.

20-10-2021 0.53
*Fixed a bug that occurred during changing the instrument while having the levels manually disabled (feature introduced in 0.51) and which resulted in the newly loaded instrument still sounding out.

18-10-2021 0.52
*Update sessions that don't have parts 11 and 12.
*Improved server-invoked load session to also include sync. Expanded server command vocabulary accordingly, adding l2ork-load-sync-delay.
*Made insert/reset/clear non-interactive (delete is manually handled using legacy code inside net-io).
*L2OrkTweet version bump.
*Updated Teacher widget to allow for convenient loading of sessions and sync-all.

16-10-2021 0.51
*Added ability to disable changes to the instrument level/overdrive when changing instruments by holding the Return/Enter key. Upon releasing the Return/Enter key, the level will revert to the one associated with the new instrument.
*Included username in saving the session.
*Created a "teacher" patch that adds ability for the instructor to alter others' settings.
*Cleaned up sessions.

11-10-2021 0.50
*Requires 20211011 build of pd-l2ork or newer.
*Fixed bug where shift+delete deleted twice.
*Added hover mode ability to add notes based on the mouse (as opposed to the time bar) position. Made erasing using delete and shift+delete to support the hover mode. Also made insert (shift+` or ~) to support the hover mode.
*Updated and optimized the left panel to make room for the hover mode option.
*Updated server to also support the hover mode.
*Swapped tab and alt key functions to make play button easier to access.
*Cleaned up and optimized L2OrkTweet.pd abstraction.
*Improved version printout for both client and server.
*Made sure that the timebar is only accessible on your own track, or on all tracks in offline mode.
*Other small bug-fixes.
*Added additional template session and 2 more presets.

01-10-2021 0.46
*Fixed inaccurate positioning of notes when manually adjusting the tracker bar location.
*Added ability to provide name for your client and enabled server handling of the same.
*Added ability for the user to copy another user's instrument preset, loop, as well as sync and all other data. See the supplemental documentation subpatch for more info.

24-09-2021 0.45
*Reversed use of ' and return keys for adjusting audio levels to minimize unwanted muting of the instrument when typing (and forgetting to disable the keyboard).
*Added more presets (new total is 90) and one new session.

10-09-2021 0.44
*Requires 20210910 build of pd-l2ork or newer.
*Reworked synth pitch transposition to allow for keyboard-based detuning without retriggering a note.

07-09-2021 0.43
*Increased maximum number of players to 12.
*Added a few more presets.

18-04-2021 0.42
*Updated patch to support new pd-l2ork 2.16 features.

19-11-2020 0.41
*Changed and improved the overdrive level keyboard shortcuts (see the documentation widget for more info).
*Added panning keyboard shortcuts and changed the loop length keyboard shortcuts to leave room for the panning shortcuts. 
*Other small cosmetic fixes.

11-11-2020 0.4
*Requires Pd-L2Ork 2.15.2 or newer.
*Based on the new preset_hub and preset_node mechanisms that allow for easier editing of the original L2OrkTweet patch.
*Improved overdrive instrument audio level slider to allow turning off the sound output with supporting keyboard shortcuts.
*Added supplemental documentation with additional keyboard shortcuts located in the top right corner of the window.
*Now includes 72 instrument presets and dozens of loops.
*Bunch of small bug fixes and cosmetic tweaks.

22-09-2020 0.36
*Requires Purr-Data 2.15 or newer.
*Changed carrier and modulator to use dropdown option which will allow for addition of new waveforms.
*Added square wave and pink noise as the fourth and fifth available waveforms for both carrier and modulator.
*Added ability to open sessions via file browser.
*Increased room for decimal pitch transposition to accomodate microtonal tuning.
*Increased room for instrument name.
*Fixed a bug where L2OrkTweet.pd abstraction got dirty every time a preset is saved.
*Added server-side ability to obfuscate key chars created on the tracker.
*47+ new instrument presets, a couple new loops, and a new demo session.
*Changed default port to 9002 since Microsoft Windows10 now has 9001 reserved system-wide.
*Ensured that the default saved and recalled loops and presets are 1, not 0.
*Minor cosmetic fixes.

16-05-2020 0.35
*Added link info in the server response as to where to download the latest version in case the client has an outdated version.
*Updated nlr abstraction to make it compatible with Purr-Data 2.11 or newer.
*Fixed regression/incompatibility with the Purr-Data 2.11 where the output level does not come up when activating instrument for the first time.
*Small typo fix in the comment.

15-05-2020 0.34
*In offline mode enabled the use of the buttons on all instruments and changed the instrument number colors to orange on the instruments that are not selected as the primary to reflect this. This should allow for a better solo live jamming setup. 
*Auto-enabled the keyboard when switching between instruments in offline mode (LATER: consider doing the same for the online connection).

06-05-2020 0.33
*Added ability to insert and delete empty notes while also reindexing all events after the time bar (keys ~ and shift+delete, respectively). This is in addition to the regular delete function that only erases the spot where the time bar is located without reindexing notes after it. You can also delete a range of values by holding delete key and sliding your slider across the tracker, as well as insert and delete at a precise location by clicking and relocating the tracker time bar before activating either action.
*Added ability to save session title using the chat message--enter the chat message before saving the session and the same will be announced both locally and over the network via console when it is recalled.
*Added ability for the server to log the number of new manually played notes (recalled loops are counted only once at the time they are recalled).
*Added server admin functions to set the same loop length for all users, or provide user-specific lengths in a form of a 10-value array.
*Cleaned-up presets and updated session files to include titles.
*Made the instrument name widget smaller to make room for the transposition number, placed the transposition number within the instrument synth parameters panel (middle upper row of the main instrument panel), and expanded the darker purple panel on the left control panel to make room for the insert control button (~ key).
*Bunch of small functional and cosmetic bug-fixes.
