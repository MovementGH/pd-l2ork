#X text 123 141 Wii Speed registers the sum of all motion (x \, roll
\, and y axes) of the Wiimote via the Wii Motion Plus Attachment (MOTION
PLUS REQUIRED). It takes one input from the Wii Connect object and
outputs values between -1 and 1 that are displayed on the object and
reflect the speed and motion direction. You can connect it to other
data objects or directly to a sound-making device to drive its loudness
or some other parameter.;
#X text 123 253 Since Wii Motion Plus by design requires calibration
\, the object tries to automatically calibrate itself as soon as it
receives data from the Wii Connect object. In case the object outputs
value other than 0 while Wiimote is still \, it may need to be recalibrated.
You can re-calibrate the object by laying wiimote flat and while keeping
it still click anywhere on the object. The value should now read zero
and you can pick up the Wiimote and resume playing with it.;
