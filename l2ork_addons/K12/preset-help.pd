program. Click on a store box to store a preset in that slot \, and
click on a recall box to recall that preset;

#X text 123 56 The preset object allows you save all the specific settings
of your objects and recall them later. For example you can save the
number in a number box. You store the values by clicking one of the
store boxes. Recall your preset by clicking the corresponding recall
box. Similarly \, you can send a number between 0 and 3 to the left
inlet to recall that preset \, or a number between 0 and 3 to the right
inlet to store that preset. Using the inlets or clicking on the boxes
does the same thing.;
#X text 123 183 The preset object can be placed anywhere in the patch
and does not have to be connected to any objects to store and recall
their values.;

#X text 122 229 In this example \, we have stored four presets that
have different numbers in this Math Number object. Click on recall
in the Preset object and notice that the number changes. Then \, change
the number in the number box and click on one of the store boxes. When
you click on the recall box for that store \, you will see that it
recalls the number you set.IMPORTANT! When recalling presets \, values
will be distributed to objects in the order they were created. This
could mean that the pitch (for instance) will reach a MIDI instrument
before loudness and as such \, the loudness change will only affect
the next note. You need to be mindful of this when creating your patch.
