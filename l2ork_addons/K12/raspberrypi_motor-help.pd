#X text 7 5 DESCRIPTION This is used to output control data from the
Modern Device's Raspberry Pi Lots of Pots shield using GPIO PWM. Specify
channel (1-10) to connect. Use channel 0 to disconnect. Give a number
from 1 to 161 to rotate a DC servo motor to such an angle degree. 0
shuts off power to the motor.;

#X text 117 44 The Raspberry Pi Motor object allows for controling
the rotation angle of a servo DC motor. It achieves this by leveraging
Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins in conjunction
with the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).In this mode PWM produces values
between on and off states by quickly switching on and off hundreds
of times per second.Channel 0 is reserved for "off" position. The
remaining 10 channels (1-10) correspond to GPIO pins (in order found
on Modern Device's Lots of Pots shield). Please note that channel 2
(pin 18) supports hardware PWM which is much more accurate than other
pins that require software PWM implementation. To change channel \,
click on the channel number and enter a new one (between 0 and 10)
or click on the number and while holding the mouse button down \, drag
the mouse up and down. If the object has successfuly connected to the
desired analog channel \, the object logo will light up.Once connected
\, the object will output scaled input data from 1 to 161 to create
a pulse signal between 1-2 milliseconds to drive the angle degree of
common DC servo motors.NB: Modern Device LOP board comes in two flavors
\, equipped with 8 pan pots (one assigned to each analog channel) \,
or as a "naked" (NOP) board that allows for easier access to pins.
