  <summary>An open source visual programming language for multimedia, based on Pure Data</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      This package contains Pd-L2Ork, which is a fork of Pure Data that
      bundles a lot of useful extensions, brings a modern HTML5-based
      user interface, and provides a set of unique features, including
      K12 beginner mode, and L2Ork-Tweeter. While Pd-L2Ork is backwards
      compatible with Pure Data and other variants, the same is not true
      the other way around. Hence, some of the most advanced content
      created in Pd-L2Ork may not run well, or at all on other Pure Data
      variants. Pd-L2Ork is a brainchild of the Virginia Tech Linux
      Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork).

    <p>
      Pure Data is an open source visual programming environment that runs on
      anything from personal computers to embedded devices (ie Raspberry Pi)
      and smartphones (via libpd, DroidParty (Android), and PdParty (iOS).
      It is a major branch of the family of patcher programming languages
      known as Max (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, etc), originally developed
      by Miller Puckette at IRCAM.

    <p>
      Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and
      developers to create software graphically without writing lines of
      code. Pd can be used to process and generate sound, video, 2D/3D
      graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI. Pd can
      easily work over local and remote networks to integrate wearable
      technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. It
      is suitable for learning basic multimedia processing and visual
      programming methods as well as for realizing complex systems for
      large-scale projects.
