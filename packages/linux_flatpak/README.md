# Pd-L2Ork packaged for Flatpak

This is a Flatpak for [Pd-L2Ork](http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/make-your-own-l2ork/software/).

Pd-L2Ork is a popular fork of the [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), an open
source visual programming language for multimedia.

## How to build

This Flatpak uses the standard
[flatpak-builder](docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder-command-reference.html)
tool to build.

You can run a command like the following to build the package from this repo
and install it in your 'user' Flatpak installation:

    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
    flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//22.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//22.08
    (press Y to continue)
    flatpak-builder --install ./build net.pdl2ork.PdL2Ork.yml --force-clean --user

During development you can also run a build without installing it, like this:

    flatpak-builder --run build net.pdl2ork.PdL2Ork.yml pd-l2ork

See the [Flatpak manual](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/) for more information.
