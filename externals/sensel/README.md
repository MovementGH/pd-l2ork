# DISIS/L2Ork Sensel 

[Pd-L2Ork](https://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/make-your-own-l2ork/software/) and [Pure-Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) external for interfacing with the [Sensel Morph](http://sensel.com/morph)

# SIMPLE INSTALLATION

Use the deken package manager to install the externals. In Pure Data, go to the "Help" menu and select **Find Externals**. Search for `sensel` or `senselmorph` and you will be given installation options. 

Install in Documents/Pd/ as recommmended by deken, unless you have a non-standard installation. 

This installs the objects as well as helpfiles and several examples that can be found in your <user documents>/Pd/externals/senselmorph folder. 
 
Here's what this looks like on a Mac after selecting a package to install in the deken panel - windows and linux are very simlar:

# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

To build for Pd-L2Ork (pd-vanilla setup may be similar with some subtle changes in the include paths and likely does not require MSYS environment, so on Windows changes may be more significant):

1. Set up a build environment:

  * On Windows follow instructions on setting up the MSYS2 environment for Pd-L2Ork (make sure it matches your OS in terms of 32-bit vs 64-bit--most modern iterations of Windows are 64-bit). Info on how to do this can be found in the [pd-l2ork repository.](https://github.com/pd-l2ork/pd-l2ork/blob/master/README.md#windows-32-bit-using-msys2)

  * On Linux and OSX make sure you have your build gcc environment all set up (consult the OS documentation)

2. Install the Sensel lib for your OS found in the [Sensel API repo](https://github.com/sensel/sensel-api/tree/master/sensel-install)

3. Using a terminal (in Windows use the MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit shell) go into this folder and run the following command (these options are assuming you have everything installed in a default path--if you don't you will need to adjust paths accordingly):

  * Linux: `make pdincludepath=/usr/include/pd-l2ork/`

  * OSX: `make pdincludepath=/Applications/Pd-l2ork.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw/include/pd-l2ork/`

  * Windows: `make pdincludepath=/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Pd-L2Ork/include/pdl2ork pdbinpath=/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Pd-L2Ork/bin/`

4. If everything compiles correctly, you should be able to run Pd-L2Ork or Pure Data Vanilla and open the `sensel-help.pd` to test it out.

# INSTALLATION
Future installations will be mediated by the [deken](https://github.com/pure-data/deken) package manager. If you need to install from this repository, use the following directions.

## macOS

### Pd-L2Ork

sensel object comes preinstalled with Pd-L2Ork.

### Vanilla PD

Copy the
```
sensel.pd_darwin
sensel-help.pd
sensel-led.pd
```
files from this repo to your `~/Documents/Pd` folder. You may want to make a "sensel" directory so you can put these files in `~/Documents/Pd/sensel`.

## Windows

### Pd-L2Ork

sensel object comes preinstalled with Pd-L2Ork.

### Vanilla PD

Copy the
```
sensel.dll
sensel-help.pd
sensel-led.pd
LibSensel.dll
LibSensel.lib
LibSenselDecompress.dll
LibSenselDecompress.lib
```
files from this repo to your user `Documents/Pd` folder. You may want to make a "sensel" directory so you can put these files in user `/Documents/Pd/sensel`.


## Linux

### Pd-L2Ork

sensel object comes preinstalled with Pd-L2Ork.

### Vanilla PD

Copy the
```
sensel.pd_linux
sensel-help.pd
sensel-led.pd
```
files from this repo to your `~/Documents/Pd` folder. You may want to make a "sensel" directory so you can put these files in `~/Documents/Pd/sensel`.

# USE

## Messages to the `sensel` object inlet:

* `discover`: discovers and connects to the first available sensel morph device
* `identify:` lists all sensel morph devices' serial numbers in the console
* `disconnect`: disconnects from a connected sensel morph device
* `connect <serial-number>`: connects to a device with a matching serial number
* `poll`: sets the polling rate in ms (1-100) at which the contact data is outputted. Each contact has 20 arguments described below
* `led <id> <brightness(0-100)>`: sets the sensel morph led brightness. Note that sending a lot of led messages can quickly bog down the sensel devicem so rate control is encouraged (e.g. see the sensel-led abstraction)


## Messages from `sensel` object outlets:

### right outlet
Indicates connection status (1=connected, 0=disconnected)

### left outlet
List of all (maximum 16) contact points, with each contact output as a list consisting of 20 arguments:

1. contact point number
2. contact status (0=invalid , 1=start , 2=move , 3=end)
3. orientation
4. major axis
5. minor axis
6. delta x
7. delta y
8. delta force
9. delta area
10. min x
11. min y
12. max x
13. max y
14. peak x
15. peak y
16. peak force
17. x position
18. y position
19. total force
20. area

More detailed descriptions of the contact data can be found in the [Sensel API guide.](http://guide.sensel.com/api/#contact-data)

# NOTES
Currently, the external only supports detecting of individual contact points and their traits. Future revisions should focus on outputting the grayscale matrix of the surface pressure in a Gem-compatible format (and/or using other Pure-Data-compatible matrix formats that may be used by alternative visual data processing libraries).
