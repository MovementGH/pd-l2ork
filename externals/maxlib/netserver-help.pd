#X text 10 10 netserver accepts two arguments: 1) port on which server
should receive connections2) OPTIONAL receiving buffer size exponent
(default 15) Second argument stands for the exponent applied to the
number 2 \, as network buffer always has to be a power of 2 \, and
large numbers entered inside the object can get truncated by Pd-L2Ork.
Therefore \, the default 15 translates to 2^15 \, or 32768 bytes. Valid
numbers are between 12 and 26 \, or 4096 bytes (4KB) and 6.71089e+07
bytes (or 64MB) Second argument is important if there are a lot of
clients and/or a lot of network traffic. Because netserver handles
messages in the Pd-L2Ork interrupt \, which by default happens every
64 bytes of audio (timing will depend on the sampling rate). Because
if this and the fact that internal buffer for storing incoming messages
is circular in nature \, it is possible that the entire buffer size
gets filled up \, which will result in data being lost and/or overwritten.
This is even more true if there are so many messages being generated
by a complex patch that during the interrupt \, netserver does not
manage to handle all of its messages and starts falling behind the
incoming data. The end result is \, once again \, lost data. Therefore
\, increasing this second argument will be critical to ensuring brief
bursts of a larger amount of data do not get partially lost \, or end-up
overwriting some other data. Note that this second buffer is created
per client. Therefore \, if you anticipate a lot of concurrent connections
\, consider the memory footprint this may generate. Buffer exponent
of 26 (64MB) * 256 clients (maximum currently supported by the netserver)
\, would take up 16GB of computer's RAM!;

#X text 10 10 netclient accepts two arguments: 1) OPTIONAL connection
type (0=TCP \, non-zero=UDP \, default 0)2) OPTIONAL receiving buffer
size exponent (default 15) Note that netserver only works with TCP
packets \, so the use of UDP packets is provided here for legacy/compatibility
purposes. Note also that while first argument is optional \, if you
wish to provide second argument \, you will need to explicitly provide
first one \, as well. In other words \, for a netclient to have a different
buffer size exponent (in this case 22 \, instead of default 15) using
TCP connection \, you should create [netclient 0 22]. [netclient
22] will not work \, as it will only make the object attempt at using
UDP connection \, as any non-zero value will be interpreted as a request
for UDP (as opposed to TCP) connection. Second argument stands for
the exponent applied to the number 2 \, as network buffer always has
to be a power of 2 \, and large numbers entered inside the object can
get truncated by Pd-L2Ork. Therefore \, the default 15 translates to
2^15 \, or 32768 bytes. Valid numbers are between 12 and 26 \, or 4096
