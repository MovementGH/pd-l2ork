TODO:
*Add interactive flag to gatoms and all iemguis that can be interacted with (tgl, bng, number2, vslider, hslider, vradio, hradio, knob, mknob)
	Gatoms need to be interactive by default DONE
	Fix weird coloring of the mknob DONE
	Finish help files

*Finish gop drawing order work (see if there is something in the branch log to pull as to the status of the work)
	Redrawing entire canvas after tidy will not be necessary anymore

*Deal with array manipulation and data structure drawing location issues

*Tooltips

*K12 menu/mode

L2Ork Tweeter:
*Smooth pitch changing (maybe hook the detuning directly to signal generators without triggering the envelope?)


DONE:
*Add focus/commit to numbox2

C:
*add toggle mode to image (using grab/motion, like gatom)
*array in s-env draws on top of cnv, which it shouldn't (requires redrawing of the entire GOP, do we really want to do this?--this should solve itself once we decide to update rather than redraw messages)
*messages should be aware of $0?
*verbosity level for the console
*Draw SECONDARY redrect on gop scalar patchers to reflect the viewport?

*object synonyms do not instantiate until the main object has been instantiated (no solution--advise getting rid of aliases or making one monster startup setup routine)
*number2 should maintain focus after return to allow for entering next value (like regular number)
	*number and number2 arrow down/up should inc/dec value
*Add  netsend/receive~ for RPi objects to the RPi build IN PROGRESS
*Redesign main window interface
*add ability to custom name each instance of pd-l2ork (pd~?)
*shared sends and receives among multiple instances?
*scalar in a subpatch is visible even if it spills outside GOP (for legacy purposes we will keep this, and will hopefully fix this soon with the implementation of a window on a canvas)
*improve dialogs IN PROGRESS
*retrofit all 3rd-party gui objects to support tkpath
	*Scope~ window name "h16ffd10" already exists in parent (likely resize hook)
		*Change appearance of the resize hook
		*change to scope~?
	*clean-up ggee/gui
=====================================

Tkpath:
*Postscript not printing? (will switch to Qt, so not necessary)
*canvas_move should take into account transformations of children? (see Jonathan's email)
